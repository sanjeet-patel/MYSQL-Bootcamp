- Implement transactions in your MySQL database to maintain data consistency.
- Practice handling errors and rolling back transactions.

## Day 9: Stored Procedures and Functions

**Project Requirements:**
- Create stored procedures and functions in MySQL.
- Implement a stored procedure to insert new blog posts with error handling.
- Use user-defined functions to perform calculations on data.

## Day 10: Triggers

**Project Requirements:**
- Write triggers in MySQL to automate actions based on database events.
- Create a trigger that logs changes to the "comments" table in a separate audit table.
- Test the trigger by adding, updating, and deleting comments.

## Day 11: Backup and Restore

**Project Requirements:**
- Set up regular database backups using MySQL's built-in tools or a backup utility.
- Practice restoring the database from a backup in case of data loss or corruption.

## Day 12: Security and User Privileges

**Project Requirements:**
- Secure your MySQL database by granting appropriate user privileges.
- Create a limited-access user for your application with only necessary permissions.
- Implement password policies and authentication mechanisms.

## Day 13: High Availability and Replication

**Project Requirements:**
- Explore high availability solutions for MySQL, such as replication and clustering.
- Set up a basic MySQL replication configuration with a master and one or more slaves.
- Test the replication by making changes on the master and observing them on the slave(s).

## Day 14: Performance Tuning

**Project Requirements:**
- Fine-tune your MySQL server for optimal performance.
- Configure the MySQL server variables like innodb_buffer_pool_size and query_cache_size.
- Monitor server performance using tools like MySQL Performance Schema.

## Day 15: Data Export and Import

**Project Requirements:**
- Learn how to export and import MySQL data using tools like mysqldump.
- Practice migrating your database from one server to another.
- Ensure data consistency during the migration process.

## Day 16: Database Design Best Practices

**Project Requirements:**
- Review database design best practices, including normalization and denormalization.
- Optimize your database schema based on the specific requirements of your application.

## Day 17: Database Version Control

**Project Requirements:**
- Implement version control for your database schema using tools like db-migrate or Liquibase.
- Maintain a history of schema changes and apply them systematically.

## Day 18: NoSQL Databases (Optional)

**Project Requirements:**
- Explore NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Redis.
- Learn the basics of NoSQL data modeling and perform simple operations.

## Day 19: Full-Text Search (Optional)

**Project Requirements:**
- Implement full-text search in MySQL using features like the MATCH() AGAINST() function.
- Index your data for efficient full-text searching.

## Day 20: Advanced MySQL Topics (Optional)

**Project Requirements:**
- Dive into advanced MySQL topics like partitioning, sharding, or InnoDB storage engine optimization.
- Explore specialized use cases like geographical data storage and retrieval.
